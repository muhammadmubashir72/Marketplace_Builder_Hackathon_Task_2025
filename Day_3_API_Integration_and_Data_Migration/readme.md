# Day 3 - API Integration and Data Migration Report - Bandage

## Objective:
The goal for Day 3 was to integrate API data into Sanity CMS for the Bandage project, enabling dynamic content updates for the marketplace. Instead of manually entering data, the API integration provided a more efficient and scalable solution.

---

## 1. Sanity CMS Schema Design:
The following fields were designed in the Sanity CMS schema for the product:

### Main Fields:
- **title**: The product title (string type).
- **description**: A detailed description of the product (text type).
- **productImage**: The main product image (image type).
- **price**: The price of the product (number type).
- **tags**: An array of tags to categorize the product (array of strings).
- **discountPercentage**: The discount percentage (number type).
- **isNew**: A boolean flag indicating if the product is new (boolean type).

### Code Snippet:

```javascript
// Sanity schema for product
export const product = defineType({
  name: "product",
  title: "Product",
  type: "document",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "title",
      title: "Title",
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
      type: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      type: "text",
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
      title: "Description",
    },
    {
      name: "productImage",
      type: "image",
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
      title: "Product Image",
    },
    {
      name: "price",
      type: "number",
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
      title: "Price",
    },
    {
      name: "tags",
      type: "array",
      title: "Tags",
      of: [{ type: "string" }],
    },
    {
      name: "discountPercentage",
      type: "number",
      title: "Discount Percentage",
    },
    {
      name: "isNew",
      type: "boolean",
      title: "New Badge",
    },
  ],
});


## 2. API Integration and Data Migration:

### API Data Fetching:
I fetched product data from an external API, which included details like images, titles, descriptions, prices, and tags. This data was then mapped to the corresponding fields in the Sanity CMS schema.

### Data Population in Sanity CMS:
After fetching the API data, I populated the product fields in Sanity CMS dynamically. This allowed for the automated population of product information, ensuring consistency and accuracy across the platform.

### Data Migration:
Using the Sanity CLI, I exported the dataset from Sanity CMS for backup purposes and later re-imported it for testing. This migration ensured that all data was properly structured and displayed as intended on the frontend.

---

## 3. Steps Taken for Data Migration:

### Exporting Data:
The first step was exporting the data from Sanity CMS using the Sanity CLI. This ensured that all product data was safely backed up before any further operations.

### Verification of Data:
The exported JSON structure was reviewed to ensure that all fields were populated correctly. This step ensured that the data would be accurately displayed when fetched and rendered on the frontend.

### Re-importing Data:
After verification, the dataset was re-imported into Sanity CMS. This confirmed that the data migration was successful and the system was working as expected.

---

## 4. Tools Used:
- **Sanity Studio**: Used for schema creation, content management, and displaying product data.
- **Sanity CLI**: Utilized for exporting and importing the dataset, ensuring data consistency and backup.
- **Sanity Vision**: Used for previewing the content in Sanity Studio.
- **Sanity Database**: To store and manage content dynamically.

## Conclusion:
The integration of API data into Sanity CMS and the data migration process was successfully completed. The system now allows for automated product data population, ensuring that content is consistently updated and accurately displayed across the platform. The data migration was verified by exporting and re-importing the dataset, confirming that the changes were implemented correctly. This process has significantly improved the scalability and efficiency of the content management system for the Bandage project.

## Future Steps:
- Automate the data fetching and population process to run periodically.
- Implement additional features such as inventory management and order tracking.
- Improve the UI/UX of the frontend display to enhance the user experience.
